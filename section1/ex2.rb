# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by ruby

puts "I could have code like this." # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# puts "This won't run."

puts "This will run."
# octothrope tells Ruby to ignore anything after it when running your code.
# Good for adding comments and troubleshooting lines of code
