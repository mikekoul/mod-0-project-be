## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

 - I like to listen and process what is being presented to me. Sometimes my question will be answered before I even ask it. If it is something pressing I will ask it right away. I typically like to ask questions at the end of the lesson when I have heard and processed the information.

2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
```
puts "Hello World"
```
3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

 - `#` - Octothorpe

4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

- An integer is a number without a decimal point. A float is used when a more precise calculation is needed and includes a decimal point.

5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

 `animal = "zebra"`

6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

`puts animal`

7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

```
puts "My favorite animal is the #{animal}."
```

8. What method is used to get input from a user?

`gets`

9. Name and describe two common string methods:

- String concatenation joins two strings using a plus sign between them
- String .length will count how many characters including spaces are in a string
