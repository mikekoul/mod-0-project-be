## Section 3 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

- It flowed really well. I typically work in 2-hour to 3-hour spurts and take short breaks every 30 mins or so. It helps my brain catch up a bit when we are being presented with so much new information. Plus my short breaks are usually used to do some kind of physical activity. Push-ups, pull-ups, or go on walks. I find working the body out is very beneficial to my brain health. I will continue to refine the technique to help promote efficiency throughout my time at Turing.  

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

- Training myself and my mind to want to hit specific goals during each work section is helping a lot in my efficiency. I feel the first couple of sections were longer than I expected but well in the time estimates. As I went through section 2 and section 3 I was able to complete them on the shorter side of the time estimates. Understanding how I work better and more efficiently has helped me a lot in a short amount of time. I am very focused on changing my career path so during my work sessions I stay away from distractions and commit to focusing for longer periods of time.

3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

- A hash is a way to define and store data where the order of the data is less important. Which is different from an array in that an array is used to define and store data in a specific ordinal way.  

4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

```
pet_store = {chew_toys: 200, fish_tank: 150, water_bowl: 55, food_bags: 300}
```

5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

`p states.values[1]`

6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

`p states.keys`
`p states.values`

7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

- When working on a recipe we would use a hash because with a hash we could assign a value to each ingredient, with an array we could only make a list of ingredients. For example with a hash we could code out our recipe as `recipe = {rice: 2cups, beans: 1_cup, protein: 1_lbs, salt: 1_tbs}`. With an array we could only list out the ingredients as `recipe = ["rice", "beans", "protein", "salt"]`.

8. What questions do you still have about hashes?

- Seems hashes have a lot of commands so I am trying to get familiar with them. I am interested to practice more with hashes in class and see all the different uses and how all the different commands work.
