## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

- Learning to program can promote better behaviors in your life. It fosters setting goals, effective effort, and motivation. Grow your skills and yourself.
- Don't worry about where other people are in their learning process. Focus on you and track your development. Instead of giving up, make mental action notes and act accordingly to learn or overcome a problem. Keep pushing and hang in there.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

- Some ways I demonstrate a Growth Mindset are my love for taking on new challenges and my resiliency when facing failure. I know if I keep at it I will eventually get through and become more proficient in something. Experimenting in a new program for my digital art is a good example. I do think though, when I have gone through a long process of learning there can come a point where I get comfortable in my level of knowledge and my mindset becomes more fixed. When I started in the cannabis industry I knew next to nothing so everyday was a new experience. About 4 years in and a good amount of knowledge and experience under my belt, I got comfortable in my job and knowledge level. This feeling comfortable bled into the rest of my life and I became a bit stagnant. Energy for the work was hard to come by. Going back to school has already reignited my energy and passion for learning everyday and its only been a week. I look forward to a career where learning is ever evolving and you are constantly being faced with new challenges to take on either individually or collaboratively.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
- A conditional statement determines if something is true or false
- `if x < 1`
- `if x == 4`
- `if x >= 6`

4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

- To set a certain condition that can be solved by a boolean expression. If the condition is met
  and proven true then a certain line of code will print. If false then the next condition is considered. The variables defined value will determine if the condition is met.

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

```
 if x == "y"
   puts "String"
```

6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

- To add to multiple conditions to an `if-statement` use `elsif` and `else`
- `elsif` is used to add additional conditions to the if statement with defined variables.
- `else` is used when none of the above conditions are met to make sure the code still runs.

7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

```
if x == "y"
   puts "String y"   
elsif x == "z"
   puts "String z"
else
  puts "String"
end  
```
